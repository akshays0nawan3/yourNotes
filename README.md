Follow the instructions given in below link to install Django
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-django-on-ubuntu/

1. After installing Python and Django you will have some folders created. In my case in /home folder /Python Codes/Django_Project two folders created. Django will store projects in above mentioned "Django_Project" folder.
2. Create folder "Notes" in "Django_Project" folder and copy downloaded code from github in it. 
3. Paste setting.py(sent you vai gmail) in internal Notes folder(Notes/Notes).
4. Type "cd Python\ Codes/Django_Project/Notes/" in terminal - as in my case Notes folder(project) is present in Django_project folder.
5. Then type python manage.py runserver
6. Open any browser and enter url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/yournotes/"

Note - No need to setup database as Django has own sqlite database
